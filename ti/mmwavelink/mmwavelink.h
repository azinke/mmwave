 \section intro_sec Introduction

 TI Automotive and Industrial mmWave Radar products are highly-integrated 77GHz CMOS millimeter
 wave devices.The devices integrate all of the RF and Analog functionality, including VCO, PLL,
 PA, LNA, Mixer and ADC for multiple TX/RX channels into a single chip.\n
 -# The AWR1243/AWR2243/xWR6243 is an RF transceiver device and it includes 4 receiver channels 
 and 3 transmit channels in a single chip. AWR2243/xWR6243 also support multi-chip cascading. \n
 -# The AWR1443/IWR1443 is a mmwave radar-on-a-chip device, which includes 4 receive channels
 and 3 transmit channels and additionally an Cortex R4F and hardware FFT accelerator.\n
 -# AWR1642 and IWR1642 are mmwave radar-on-a-chip device, which includes 4 receive channels and 2
 transmit channels and additionally an Cortex R4F and C674x DSP for signal processing

 TI mmWave radar devices include a mmwave front end or BIST (Built-in Self-Test) processor, which
 is responsible to configure the RF/Analog and digital front-end in real-time, as well as to
 periodically schedule calibration  and functional safety monitoring.This enables the mmwave
 front-end(BIST processor) to be self-contained and capable of adapting itself to handle
 temperature and ageing effects, and to enable significant ease-of-use from an external host
 perspective.

 TI mmwave front end is a closed subsystem whose internal blocks are configurable using messages
 coming over mailbox.\n TI mmWaveLink provides APIs generates these message and sends it to mmwave
 front end over mailbox. It also includes acknowledement and CRC for each message to provide a
 reliable communication

 TI mmWaveLink Framework:
 - Is a link between application and mmwave front end.
 - Provides low level APIs to configure the front end and handles the communication with the front
   end.
 - Is platform and OS independent which means it can be ported into any processor which provides
   communication interface such as SPI and basic OS routines. The mmWaveLink framework can also
   run in single threaded environment
 - Is integrated into mmWave SDK and can run on R4F or DSP and communicates with mmwave front
   end over Mailbox interface

  \section modules_sec Modules
  To make it simple, TI's mmWaveLink framework capabilities are divided into modules.\n
  These capabilities include device control, RF/Analog configuration, ADC configuration,
  Data path(LVDS/CSI2) cofiguration, FMCW chirp configuration and more.\n
  Listed below are the various modules in the mmWaveLink framework:
      -# \ref Device - Controls mmwave radar device which include:

            * Initialization, such as: mmwave device power On/Off, Firmware Patch download
            * Cascade device configuration such as Add/Connect multiple mmWave devices

      -# \ref Sensor - The RF/Sensor Configuration module controls the different HW blocks
             inside mmWave Front end.

       *  @image html mmwave_frontend.png

         * mmWave Front End has below key blocks
         -# Chirp sequencer (Radar Timing Engine) - This block is responsible for constructing
            the sequence of FMCW chirps or frames and programming the timing engine
         -# Rx/Tx Channel - This defines how many Rx and Tx channel needs to be enabled. Also it
            defines how to configure the mmWave front end in cascade mode for Imaging Radar
         -# Rx Analog Chain - This defines how the received signal is mixed and how different
            filters in the chain can be configured
         -# ADC and Digital Front End Configuration - This defines how the IF data is digitized
            and how it is sampled for further processing in the DSP or Hardware Accelerator.
            Same ADC data can be sent over LVDS/CSI2 interface to an extenal processor

       * The configuration APIs can further be categorized as.\n
       -# mmwave static configuration, such as: Tx and Rx channel, ADC configuration etc
       -# mmwave dynamic configuration, such as FMCW Chirp configuration, profile configuration
       -# mmwave advance configuration such as Binary phase modulation, Dynamic power save etc
       -# mmwave sensor control, such as: Frame start/stop

      -# \ref Data_Path - The Data path Configuration module controls the high speed interface
              in mmWave device.

       *  @image html data_path.png

       * The configuration APIs include.\n
       -# High Speed interface(LVDS/CSI2) selection
       -# Data format and rate configuration
       -# ADC, Chirp Profile(CP), Chirp Quality(CQ) data transfer sequence
       -# Lane configurations
       -# LVDS/CSI2 specific configuration

      -# \ref Monitoring - The Monitoring/Calibration module configures the calibration and
              functional safety monitoring in mmWave device

     * TI mmWave Front end includes built-in processor that is programmed by TI to handle RF
      calibrations and functional safety monitoring.  The RF calibrations ensure that the
      performance of the device is maintained across temperature and process corners

      -# \ref Communication_Protocol - The mmWave communication protocol ensures reliable
              communication between host(internal or external) and mmWave Front end.

        -# It is a simple stop and wait protocol. Each message needs to be acknowledged
            by receiver before next message can be sent.
        -# Messages are classifieds as "Command", "Response" and "Asynchronous Event"
        -# If Command can not be processed immediately, ACK response is sent immediately
            (If requested). "Asynchronous Event"  is sent upon completion of the command
            execution.

     \section         proting_sec     Porting Guide

 The porting of the mmWaveLink driver to any new platform is based on few simple steps.
 This guide takes you through this process step by step. Please follow the instructions
 carefully to avoid any problems during this process and to enable efficient and proper
 work with the device.
 Please notice that all modifications and porting adjustments of the driver should be
 made in the application only and driver should not be modified.
 Changes in the application file will ensure smoothly transaction to
 new versions of the driver at the future!

 \subsection     porting_step1   Step 1 - Define mmWaveLink client callback structure
The mmWaveLink framework is ported to different platforms using mmWaveLink client callbacks. These
callbacks are grouped as different structures such as OS callbacks, Communication Interface
callbacks and others. Application needs to define these callbacks and initialize the mmWaveLink
framework with the structure.

 *  @code
 *  rlClientCbs_t clientCtx = { 0 };
 *  rlReturnVal_t retVal;
 *  rlUInt32_t deviceMap = RL_DEVICE_MAP_CASCADED_1;
 *  @endcode

 Refer to \ref rlClientCbs_t for more details

 \subsection     porting_step2   Step 2 - Implement Communication Interface Callbacks
 The mmWaveLink device support several standard communication protocol among SPI and MailBox
  Depending on device variant, one need to choose the communication channel. For e.g
 xWR1443/xWR1642/xWR1843 requires Mailbox interface and AWR1243/AWR2243/xWR6243 supports SPI 
 interface. The interface for this communication channel should include 4 simple access functions:
 -# rlComIfOpen
 -# rlComIfClose
 -# rlComIfRead
 -# rlComIfWrite

 *  @code
 *  clientCtx.comIfCb.rlComIfOpen = Host_spiOpen;
 *  clientCtx.comIfCb.rlComIfClose = Host_spiClose;
 *  clientCtx.comIfCb.rlComIfRead = Host_spiRead;
 *  clientCtx.comIfCb.rlComIfWrite = Host_spiWrite;
 *  @endcode

 Refer to \ref rlComIfCbs_t for interface details

  \subsection     porting_step3   Step 3 - Implement Device Control Interface
 The mmWaveLink driver internally powers on/off the mmWave radar device. The exact implementation
 of these interface is platform dependent, hence you need to implement below functions:
 -# rlDeviceEnable
 -# rlDeviceDisable
 -# rlRegisterInterruptHandler

 *  @code
 *  clientCtx.devCtrlCb.rlDeviceDisable = Host_disableDevice;
 *  clientCtx.devCtrlCb.rlDeviceEnable = Host_enableDevice;
 *  clientCtx.devCtrlCb.rlDeviceMaskHostIrq = Host_spiIRQMask;
 *  clientCtx.devCtrlCb.rlDeviceUnMaskHostIrq = Host_spiIRQUnMask;
 *  clientCtx.devCtrlCb.rlRegisterInterruptHandler = Host_registerInterruptHandler;
 *  clientCtx.devCtrlCb.rlDeviceWaitIrqStatus = Host_deviceWaitIrqStatus;
 *  @endcode

 Refer to \ref rlDeviceCtrlCbs_t for interface details

 \subsection     porting_step4     Step 4 - Implement Event Handlers
 The mmWaveLink driver reports asynchronous event indicating mmwave radar device status,
 exceptions etc. Application can register this callback to receive these notification and take
 appropriate actions

 *  @code
 *  clientCtx.eventCb.rlAsyncEvent = Host_asyncEventHandler;
 *  @endcode

 Refer to \ref rlEventCbs_t for interface details

 \subsection     porting_step5     Step 5 - Implement OS Interface
 The mmWaveLink driver can work in both OS and NonOS environment. If Application prefers to use
 operating system, it needs to implement basic OS routines such as tasks, mutex and Semaphore.
 In Case of Non-OS environment application needs to implement equivalent form of mutex & semaphore.

 *  @code
 *  clientCtx.osiCb.mutex.rlOsiMutexCreate = Host_osiLockObjCreate;
 *  clientCtx.osiCb.mutex.rlOsiMutexLock = Host_osiLockObjLock;
 *  clientCtx.osiCb.mutex.rlOsiMutexUnLock = Host_osiLockObjUnlock;
 *  clientCtx.osiCb.mutex.rlOsiMutexDelete = Host_osiLockObjDelete;
 *
 *  clientCtx.osiCb.sem.rlOsiSemCreate = Host_osiSyncObjCreate;
 *  clientCtx.osiCb.sem.rlOsiSemWait = Host_osiSyncObjWait;
 *  clientCtx.osiCb.sem.rlOsiSemSignal = Host_osiSyncObjSignal;
 *  clientCtx.osiCb.sem.rlOsiSemDelete = Host_osiSyncObjDelete;
 *
 *  clientCtx.osiCb.queue.rlOsiSpawn = Host_osiSpawn;
 *
 *  clientCtx.timerCb.rlDelay = Host_osiSleep;
 *  @endcode


 Refer to \ref rlOsiCbs_t for interface details

 \subsection     porting_step6     Step 6 - Implement CRC Interface and Type
 The mmWaveLink driver uses CRC for message integrity. If Application prefers to use
 CRC, it needs to implement CRC routine and provides the CRC type.

 *  @code
 *  clientCtx.crcCb.rlComputeCRC = Host_computeCRC;
 *  clientCtx.crcType = RL_CRC_TYPE_32BIT;
 *  @endcode

 Refer to \ref rlCrcCbs_t for interface details
 @note : Recommended CRC type is RL_CRC_TYPE_32BIT for AWR1243/AWR2243/xWR6243 device.

 \subsection     porting_step7     Step 7 - Implement Debug Interface
 The mmWaveLink driver can print the debug message. If Application prefers to enable
 debug messages, it needs to implement debug callback.

 Refer to \ref rlDbgCb_t for interface details

 \subsection     porting_final     Final Step - Initializing mmWaveLink Driver
 Once all the above Interfaces are implemented, Application need to fill these callbacks
 in \ref rlClientCbs_t and Initialize mmWaveLink by passing the client callbacks.
 Application also need to define where the mmWaveLink driver is running, for e.g,
 External Host in case of AWR1243/AWR2243/xWR6243 or MSS/DSS in case of xWR1642/xWR1843.

 *
 *  @code
 *  clientCtx.platform = RL_PLATFORM_HOST;
 *  clientCtx.arDevType = RL_AR_DEVICETYPE_12XX;
 *
 *  retVal = rlDevicePowerOn(deviceMap, clientCtx);
 *  @endcode
 *
  \subsection     porting_crc     CRC Type Implementation
  Device sets same CRC type as recieved command to response message. So change to command's
  CRC type will cause a change to response's CRC type as well. [Refer to \ref porting_step7].
  mmWave device(MasterSS & RadarSS) uses 16-bit CRC type by default for async-event messages.
  If Host needs to set different CRC type to Async-event then it must implement the following
  code snippet.
 *
 *  @code
 *  rlRfDevCfg_t rfDevCfg = {0x0};
 *  // set global and monitoring async event direction to Host
 *  rfDevCfg.aeDirection = 0x05;
 *  // Set the CRC type of Async event received from RadarSS
 *  rfDevCfg.aeCrcConfig = RL_CRC_TYPE_32BIT;
 *  retVal = rlRfSetDeviceCfg(deviceMap, &rfDevCfg);
 *
 *  rlDevMiscCfg_t devMiscCfg = {0};
 *  // Set the CRC Type for Async Event from MSS
 *  devMiscCfg.aeCrcConfig = RL_CRC_TYPE_32BIT;
 *  retVal = rlDeviceSetMiscConfig(deviceMap, &devMiscCfg);
 *  @endcode
 *
  \subsection     porting_be     Big Endian Support
 The mmWaveLink driver by default is enabled for Little Endian host. Support for
 Big Endian is provided as compile time option using a Pre-processor Macro MMWL_BIG_ENDIAN. \n
 For memory optimizations, mmWaveLink doesn't swap the data elements in structure buffer. It
 is the responsibility of the application to swap multi byte data elements before passing the
 structure buffer to mmWaveLink API. Since SPI word-size is 16bit, Swap of 32 bit fields such
 as integer needs to be done at 16bit boundary.
 @note 1: Please refer latest mmWave device DFP release notes for all known issues and de-featured
          APIs. \n
 @note 2: All reserved bits/bytes in API sub blocks shall be programmed with value zero. The
          functionality of radar device is not guaranteed if reserved bytes are not zero. \n
 @note 3: All reserved bits/bytes in API message reports shall be masked off. \n
  *
  \subsection     notes     General Notes
        -# Host should ensure that there is a delay of at least 2 SPI clocks between CS going low 
           and start of SPI clock.
        -# Host should ensure that CS is toggled for every 16 bits of transfer via SPI.
        -# There should be a delay of at least 2 SPI Clocks between consecutive CS.
        -# SPI needs to be operated at Mode 0 (Phase 1, Polarity 0).
        -# SPI word length should be 16 bit (Half word).
 *
  \subsection     appl_notes     Application Care Abouts
        -# Retry of RF Power up message is unsupported.
        -# HOST is recommended to wait for RF Power Async msg before any further APIs are issued. 
           Lack of RF Power up Async msg should be treated as bootup failure.
        -# It is recommended to wait for Async event for Latent fault injection API before the 
           next CMD is issued.
        -# HOST to ensure a delay of 30us in response to the HOST_IRQ interrupt, to allow for a 
           SPI DMA configuration in device post HOST_IRQ set high.
        -# It is recommended to use 232 as the chunk size in mmWavelink/HOST when firmware 
           download is done through SPI.
 *
  \subsection     api_error_handling     API Error Handling and Error Codes
  This section describes the error handling of various fault messages in device and information 
  about error codes. The AWR2243/xWR6243 device sends out error info in the form of AE messages 
  in case of any fault in the device. \n
  The ERROR_CODE returned part of monitor AE message reports are informative purpose only, these 
  error codes are helpful to debug the cause for monitor failure. \n
  Application can log these information and share with TI in case of any runtime errors. The 
  information about these error codes are documented in  the "API Error Codes" section. \n
  The Application shall handle the monitor failures reported in  STATUS_FLAGS part of monitor AE 
  message appropriately, device may not need restart in these error cases and these errors needs 
  to be handled case by case. For example AWR_MONITOR_RX_GAIN_PHASE_REPORT_AE_SB can report 
  failure in presence of interference, this is not a fatal error in the device. \n
  Please refer Monitoring app note for more info on monitor reports and thresholds. \n
  The information about API_RESP Error codes returned in ACK messages part of AWR_RESP_ERROR_SB 
  for each API commands are documented in "API Error Codes" section, these error codes are 
  helpful to debug the cause for API failure and errors can be corrected during development 
  time. \n
  The following AE messages are Fatal errors and device shall be restarted upon receiving these 
  messages:
        -# AWR_AE_RF_CPUFAULT_SB
        -# AWR_AE_RF_ESMFAULT_SB for ESM_GROUP2_ERRORS only
        -# AWR_ANALOGFAULT_AE_SB
        -# AWR_AE_MSS_CPUFAULT_SB
        -# AWR_AE_MSS_ESMFAULT_STATUS_SB for ESM_GROUP2_ERRORS only
        -# AWR_AE_MSS_RFERROR_STATUS_SB for cases ERROR_STATUS_FLAG = 0x1, 0x2 and 0x4 only
        -# AWR_AE_RF_ESMFAULT_SB for PROG_FILT_FATAL_PARITY_ERROR and PROG_FILT_FATAL_DB_ECC_ERROR 
           in ESM_GROUP1_ERRORS only
        -# AWR_AE_MSS_ESMFAULT_STATUS_SB for "FRC Lock Step Error" in ESM_GROUP1_ERRORS only
